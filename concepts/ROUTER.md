2.SPA navigation
  As the user navigates, views are seamlessly displayed. This, combined with the asyn- chronous fetching of data, gives the application a smooth, native-like feel that makes for a great user experience. No more of the jarring interruptions that you usually experience when a page is wiped clean and a new page is downloaded and displayed. The SPA does all of this without refreshing the initial page after it’s loaded.参考目录中的images/figure2.9
  
  客户端路由不仅仅是简单的组件切换，同时它还负责的view,data,logic的状态管理，这一切都由javascript负责，可行吗？事实证明，不仅可行，而且也是非常简单的。
